   Putting alt in case the images are not coming out or making the font size big enough to read. Other people used templates and moving pictures which I thought was 
   really cool. They embedded it. I am proud of learning how to change fonts because it took me a whole hour!

   A variable is used to store information. Loops are used to repeat certain actions. There are different types like a for loop which is used when
   you know how many times you want to repeat something. A while loop is used when you know the outcome but not how many times you need to repeat it. 
   Conditionals perform different actions. Functions saves different codes this can be used to again and also makes things look cleaner.

   A list is a collection of information. It allows you to collect and store data faster. With a list it is easier to perform different tasks.

 I have a love and hate relationship with robotics. Robotics is very hands on so I really enjoyed building circuits and finding out how to turn on the LED. As the week progressed it became a lot more fun but also a lot harder. We worked with the arduino and coding to make the robot work was a challenge but I ended up learning so much.

   This experience was great, I got to meet people who have used their backgrounds and technology in law. It shows how intertwined technology is in every career. We meet people from the Department of Defense, someone who is starting a high school for computer science, and some lawyers who were involved in advocating for equal rights. I am very thankful to GirlsWhoCode and Gibson Dunn for the opportunity.

  We learned about how different sites like pinterest use Javascript to make their pages interactive. I used Javascript to change a picture when it is clicked. It really made the website better.

At first it was very challenging because every command had to be perfectly copied and even one slip up could ause you to start the whole process over. I was having trouble for the first half of the day but I slowed down to really take in all the information and I ended up working without any mstakes for the last half of the day. Very proud moment.

 This week we learned about data structure, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. I have a better grip on the meaning of data structures. We used binary search to search through different data. We learned about classes and how to connect everything we have learned about. We created social networks that allowed us to add connections.
